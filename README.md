This repository contains the implementation, experiments, and resources for our paper "Hypergraph-based Motion Generation with Multi-modal Interaction Relational Reasoning". 

The work leverages hypergraph neural networks to model complex, multi-agent interactions across diverse modalities, enabling advanced relational reasoning for motion generation tasks.
